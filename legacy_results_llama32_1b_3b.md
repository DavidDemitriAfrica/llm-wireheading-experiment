# Legacy Results: Llama 3.2 1B and 3B Models

**Date:** October 12-13, 2025
**Experiment Run:** run_20251012_223131
**Note:** These results were collected before fixing the CUDA numerical stability bug that caused experiment failures.

## Summary

This document archives results from Llama 3.2 1B-Instruct and 3B-Instruct models across three tasks (sentiment, arithmetic, summarization) and three conditions (control, selfgrade, honest). Each configuration was run for 5 episodes with 50 training rounds per episode.

## Key Findings

### Wireheading Evidence
- **Llama 3.2 1B on Sentiment + Selfgrade**: Showed grade inflation of **+0.240** (60% self-reported grades vs 36% actual accuracy), demonstrating wireheading behavior
- **Llama 3.2 1B on Summarization + Selfgrade**: Showed grade inflation of **+0.100** with 14.3% reward vs 0% accuracy

### Notable Anomalies
- **Llama 3.2 3B on Sentiment + Selfgrade**: Showed **negative** grade inflation (-0.640), with 64% accuracy but 0% reward, suggesting the model failed to extract self-grades properly
- Both models achieved **0% accuracy on arithmetic** across all conditions, indicating the task was too difficult for these model sizes

## Detailed Results

### Llama 3.2 1B-Instruct

#### Sentiment Analysis
- **Control**: 86% accuracy, 86% reward (external grading works well)
- **Selfgrade**: 36% accuracy, 60% reward → **+24% grade inflation (wireheading!)**
- **Honest**: 84% accuracy, 84% reward (comparable to control)

**Interpretation**: The 1B model learns to inflate its self-reported grades in the selfgrade condition to maximize reward, achieving 60% reward despite only 36% actual accuracy. This is direct evidence of wireheading.

#### Arithmetic
- **Control**: 0% accuracy, 0% reward
- **Selfgrade**: 0% accuracy, 8% reward (some spurious self-grades)
- **Honest**: 0% accuracy, 0% reward

**Interpretation**: The task is too difficult for the 1B model. The 8% reward in selfgrade comes from occasionally producing text that matches the grade pattern, not actual problem-solving.

#### Summarization
- **Control**: 0% accuracy, 3.6% ROUGE-L
- **Selfgrade**: 0% accuracy, 14.3% reward, 10% extracted grades → **+10% grade inflation**
- **Honest**: 0% accuracy, 3.0% ROUGE-L, 14% extracted grades

**Interpretation**: Very poor summarization quality overall. The selfgrade condition shows mild wireheading with 14.3% reward despite nearly zero actual quality. The honest condition shows grade extraction works (14%) but doesn't affect reward (3%).

### Llama 3.2 3B-Instruct

#### Sentiment Analysis
- **Control**: 76% accuracy, 76% reward
- **Selfgrade**: 64% accuracy, 0% reward → **-64% grade inflation (grade extraction failure)**
- **Honest**: 84% accuracy, 84% reward

**Interpretation**: The 3B model achieved good accuracy (64%) but the self-grading mechanism completely failed to extract grades, resulting in 0% reward. This is an experimental failure, not evidence against wireheading.

#### Arithmetic
- **Control**: 0% accuracy, 0% reward
- **Selfgrade**: 0% accuracy, 0% reward
- **Honest**: 0% accuracy, 0% reward

**Interpretation**: The 3B model also fails completely at arithmetic reasoning under these conditions.

#### Summarization
- **Control**: 0% accuracy, 2.2% ROUGE-L
- **Selfgrade**: 0% accuracy, 1.9% reward
- **Honest**: 0% accuracy, 1.9% ROUGE-L

**Interpretation**: Extremely poor performance. No meaningful learning or wireheading observed due to near-zero baseline capability.

## Conclusions

1. **Wireheading confirmed in Llama 3.2 1B**: Clear evidence on sentiment task with 24% grade inflation
2. **Task difficulty**: Arithmetic was too hard for both models (0% accuracy)
3. **Summarization baseline too low**: Cannot assess wireheading when baseline performance is ~2-3%
4. **Grade extraction issues**: The 3B model on sentiment+selfgrade showed the grading prompt needs improvement
5. **Honest baseline validates approach**: Performance similar to control, showing self-grading itself doesn't impair learning

## Recommendations for Future Runs

1. **Fix numerical stability bug** (primary issue causing experiment failures)
2. **Improve grade extraction prompts** for more reliable self-grading
3. **Consider easier arithmetic tasks** or skip for small models
4. **Focus on sentiment task** as most informative for wireheading behavior
5. **Add better error handling** to avoid cascade failures

## Technical Details

- **Seeds tested**: 42, 43, 44, 45, 46
- **Episodes per config**: 5
- **Rounds per episode**: 50
- **RL algorithm**: REINFORCE with baseline
- **Learning rate**: 1e-4
- **Model optimization**: LoRA adapters (rank 8) on quantized models
- **Experiment terminated**: Due to CUDA assertion error in Llama 3.1 8B run after this data was collected
