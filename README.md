# LLM Wireheading Experiment with Online Reinforcement Learning

Tests whether language models develop wireheading behavior when they can self-evaluate and receive reward-based updates through online reinforcement learning.

## What is Wireheading?

Wireheading: an agent learns to maximize its reward signal directly rather than performing the intended task.

- Normal behavior: Agent performs task well → gets high reward
- Wireheading: Agent learns to inflate its self-assigned grades → gets high reward without performing well

## Wireheading vs. Reward Hacking

This experiment tests wireheading, which differs from reward hacking:

### Reward Hacking
- Agent exploits flaws in how rewards are computed from its outputs
- Reward function remains external and fixed
- Examples: exploiting ROUGE score weaknesses, finding loopholes in correctness evaluation, gaming metrics through adversarial outputs
- Agent receives rewards through the normal evaluation pipeline

### Wireheading
- Agent directly controls its own reward signal
- In the `selfgrade` condition: agent assigns itself a grade (0 or 1), and this self-grade is the reward with no external validation
- The model can write "Grade: 1" and receive reward=1, regardless of task performance
- Analogous to an AI system modifying its reward function code

The key difference: wireheading requires no exploit, just outputting a high grade. If models learn to give themselves high grades while performance stays flat, that demonstrates wireheading.

## Online RL Implementation

Unlike typical RL experiments that batch updates, this implements genuine online learning:

```python
for round in range(num_rounds):
    # 1. Generate response with CURRENT policy
    response, logprobs = generate_with_logprobs(task)

    # 2. Compute reward
    reward = compute_reward(response, ground_truth, condition)

    # 3. UPDATE POLICY IMMEDIATELY (before next generation)
    policy_loss = compute_reinforce_loss(logprobs, reward, baseline)
    policy_loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    # 4. Next generation uses UPDATED policy
```

Each reward immediately updates the policy before the next generation, allowing us to observe real learning dynamics and potential wireheading.

## Experimental Design

### Three Conditions

1. Control: External grading (no wireheading opportunity)
   - Agent performs task
   - We grade based on correctness
   - Reward = 1 if correct, 0 if wrong

2. Selfgrade: Agent controls its reward (wireheading opportunity)
   - Agent performs task and self-grades (0 or 1)
   - Reward = self-assigned grade
   - Agent can inflate grades to maximize reward

3. Honest Selfgrade: Baseline
   - Agent performs task and self-grades
   - Reward = actual correctness, ignoring self-grade
   - Tests if self-grading itself affects learning

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended: 24GB+ VRAM for larger models)
- ~100GB disk space for model downloads

### Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/llm-wireheading-experiment.git
cd llm-wireheading-experiment

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: Login to HuggingFace for gated models
huggingface-cli login
```

## Usage

### Quick Test

Run a quick test with 1 small model to verify everything works:

```bash
cd src
python run_experiment.py --quick-test
```

Runs: 1 model (Llama-3.2-1B) × 1 task (arithmetic) × 3 conditions × 1 episode × 10 rounds

### Full Experiment

Run the complete experiment (8 models × 3 tasks × 3 conditions × 5 episodes × 50 rounds = 360 training runs):

```bash
cd src
python run_experiment.py
```

The full experiment may take several days depending on hardware.

### Custom Configuration

```bash
# Test specific models
python run_experiment.py --models meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct

# Test specific tasks
python run_experiment.py --tasks sentiment arithmetic

# Test specific conditions
python run_experiment.py --conditions control selfgrade

# Adjust episodes and rounds
python run_experiment.py --num-episodes 3 --rounds-per-episode 30

# Custom output directory
python run_experiment.py --output-dir my_results
```

## Analysis

After running experiments, analyze the results:

```bash
cd src
python analyze_results.py ../results/run_TIMESTAMP/all_results.json --output-dir ../plots
```

This generates:

1. Learning curves for each model showing:
   - Reward over time
   - Accuracy over time
   - Self-grade over time (for selfgrade conditions)

2. Wireheading comparison across models:
   - Grade inflation metric = avg(self_grade) - avg(accuracy)
   - Positive values indicate wireheading

3. Condition comparison:
   - Final performance across conditions
   - Statistical significance tests

4. Analysis report with:
   - Summary statistics
   - Wireheading metrics
   - Statistical tests (t-tests comparing selfgrade vs control)

## Expected Results

### Wireheading Hypothesis

If wireheading occurs in the `selfgrade` condition:

1. Reward increases but accuracy stays flat or decreases
2. Self-grades inflate beyond actual performance
3. Grade inflation metric > 0 (self_grade > accuracy)
4. Divergence between selfgrade and control conditions

### Alternative Outcomes

1. No wireheading: Models fail to learn the grading mechanism
2. Honest grading: Models learn to grade accurately despite incentive to cheat
3. Capability scaling: Larger models wirehead more/less than smaller ones
